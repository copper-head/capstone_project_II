[Alice]: Bob, let's reschedule the sprint planning from Thursday at 9 to Friday at 11.

[Bob]: Sure, Friday at 11 works. I'll update my calendar.

[Alice]: Actually wait, on second thought let's just cancel it entirely. We can fold it into Monday's standup.

[Bob]: Okay, so forget the reschedule - we're just cancelling it?

[Alice]: Yes, just cancel the Thursday sprint planning. We don't need it this week.

[Bob]: Got it. Cancelled.
