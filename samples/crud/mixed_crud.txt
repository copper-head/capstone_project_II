[Alice]: Alright team, a few scheduling changes for this week.

[Bob]: Go ahead, I'm listening.

[Alice]: First, let's set up a new design review on Wednesday at 2 PM in the design lab. Bob and Carol, you're both needed.

[Carol]: Wednesday at 2 works for me.

[Bob]: Same here. Design lab, got it.

[Alice]: Second, we need to move the sprint planning from Thursday at 9 AM to Friday at 10 AM. The product team needs more time to finalize the backlog.

[Bob]: Friday at 10 it is. That actually works better for me anyway.

[Alice]: And lastly, cancel the retrospective that was on Friday at 3 PM. We'll roll it into next week's session instead.

[Carol]: Fine by me. That frees up my Friday afternoon.

[Alice]: Great. So to summarize: new design review Wednesday at 2, sprint planning moved to Friday at 10, and retro on Friday is cancelled.

[Bob]: Got it all. Thanks for the heads up.

[Carol]: Thanks Alice!
