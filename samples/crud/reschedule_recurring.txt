[Alice]: Hey Carol, about tomorrow's weekly team sync at 10 AM.

[Carol]: The recurring one? What about it?

[Alice]: I have a dentist appointment at 10 tomorrow so I need to push it back. Can we do 11:30 instead, just for this week?

[Carol]: 11:30 works for me. I'll let the rest of the team know.

[Alice]: Thanks. Same room, same agenda, just an hour and a half later.

[Carol]: Got it. Just this week's instance, the regular 10 AM slot stays for next week.

[Alice]: Exactly. You're the best, Carol.

[Carol]: No problem!
