[Alice]: Carol, I need to push back the meeting with the marketing team.

[Carol]: Which one? We have the campaign review on Tuesday and the brand sync on Wednesday. Both are with marketing.

[Alice]: Oh right, I forgot there were two. The one on Tuesday - the campaign review. Can we move that to Thursday at the same time?

[Carol]: Sure, the Tuesday 2 PM campaign review moves to Thursday 2 PM. The Wednesday brand sync stays as is?

[Alice]: Yes, Wednesday stays. Just the Tuesday one needs to move.

[Carol]: Done. Campaign review is now Thursday at 2.
