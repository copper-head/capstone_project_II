[Carol]: Hey Dave, I need to talk to you about the code review we have scheduled for tomorrow afternoon.

[Dave]: The one at 2 PM? Sure, what's going on?

[Carol]: I need to cancel it. The feature branch isn't ready yet and there's no point reviewing incomplete code.

[Dave]: That makes sense. No worries at all.

[Carol]: I'll reschedule once the branch is in better shape. Probably sometime next week.

[Dave]: Sounds good. Just let me know when you're ready and we'll set something up.

[Carol]: Will do. Thanks for understanding!
