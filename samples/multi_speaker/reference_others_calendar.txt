[Alice]: Bob, don't forget you have that dentist appointment tomorrow at 2 PM.

[Bob]: Oh right, thanks for the reminder. I almost scheduled over it.

[Alice]: Also, Carol mentioned she has a doctor's visit on Thursday morning. Let's not schedule any team meetings before noon on Thursday.

[Bob]: Good call. What about our weekly sync, should we move it?

[Alice]: Let's move our sync to Thursday at 1 PM instead of the usual 10 AM. That way Carol can join after her appointment.

[Bob]: Thursday at 1 PM works for me.
