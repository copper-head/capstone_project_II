[Alice]: Let's schedule the team offsite for next Friday.

[Bob]: Friday? I was thinking Thursday would be better.

[Carol]: I agree with Bob, Thursday makes more sense since people leave early on Fridays.

[Alice]: Hmm, but the venue is only available Friday. How about we compromise - Friday but we start early at 9 AM so we finish by 3?

[Bob]: I'd still prefer Thursday but if the venue is only free Friday then I guess Friday it is.

[Carol]: Fine, Friday at 9. Where is it?

[Alice]: Riverside Conference Center. I'll book 9 AM to 3 PM.

[Bob]: Alright, I'll be there. But I'm leaving at 2:30, I have to pick up my kids.

[Alice]: That's fine Bob. Carol, you're in for the full day?

[Carol]: Yes, 9 to 3 works for me.
