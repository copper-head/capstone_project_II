[Alice]: Alright, let's talk about the Q3 roadmap.

[Bob]: Before that, Carol - want to grab coffee after this?

[Carol]: Sure Bob, meet me at the lobby cafe at 3?

[Bob]: 3 works.

[Alice]: Okay, back to the roadmap. Dave, we need to schedule the architecture deep dive.

[Dave]: How about Friday at 1 PM? We'll need at least 2 hours.

[Alice]: Friday at 1 works. Let's book the large conference room.

[Carol]: Bob, actually make it 3:30 for coffee. I have a call at 2:45 that might run over.

[Bob]: 3:30 it is.

[Dave]: Alice, should we invite the backend team to the deep dive?

[Alice]: Yes, good idea. Loop in the backend leads.

[Carol]: Are we done here? I need to prep for my call.

[Alice]: Yes, we're done. Thanks everyone.
