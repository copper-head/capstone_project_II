[Alice]: Hey Carol, I need to schedule a call with the London team. Can you make it?

[Carol]: Sure, when are you thinking?

[Alice]: They suggested 3 PM their time, which would be... let me think... 10 AM for us.

[Carol]: Tuesday?

[Alice]: Yeah, Tuesday works. It's going to be a video call so make sure your camera works this time.

[Carol]: Ha, that was ONE time. Okay, 10 AM our time Tuesday. Got it.

[Alice]: Also, Dave from the Tokyo office wants to do a quick sync. He said 9 AM his time on Wednesday, so that'd be like... 7 PM our time? Is that too late?

[Carol]: 7 PM is a bit rough but I can make it work. It's just 30 minutes right?

[Alice]: Yeah, should be quick. He just wants to go over the API changes.

[Carol]: Fine. So Tuesday at 10 with London, Wednesday at 7 PM with Tokyo. I'll put them both on my calendar.

[Alice]: Perfect. Thanks Carol!
