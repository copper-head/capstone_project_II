[Alice]: We should really get together and plan the product roadmap.

[Bob]: Agreed. When were you thinking?

[Alice]: Sometime next week maybe? I'm pretty flexible.

[Bob]: Next week is a bit hectic for me. Maybe later in the week?

[Alice]: Thursday or Friday could work. Let's say sometime in the afternoon.

[Bob]: Sounds vague but let's aim for that. We'll probably need a couple of hours at least.

[Alice]: Yeah, true. I'll try to pin down a more specific time and send you an invite.

[Bob]: Works for me. Just let me know.
