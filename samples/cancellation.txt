[Alice]: Hey Bob, I need to talk to you about our meeting on Friday.

[Bob]: Sure, what's up?

[Alice]: I'm really sorry but I need to cancel. Something came up with the client and I'll be traveling all day Friday.

[Bob]: No worries at all. Should we reschedule for next week?

[Alice]: Let's just cancel for now. I'll reach out when my schedule clears up.

[Bob]: Sounds good. Hope the client stuff goes well.

[Alice]: Thanks, I appreciate it. Talk soon!
