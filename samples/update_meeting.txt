[Alice]: Hey Bob, about our team standup tomorrow morning.

[Bob]: Yeah, the 9 AM one? What about it?

[Alice]: Can we push it to 10 AM instead? I have a dentist appointment first thing in the morning.

[Bob]: Sure, 10 AM works for me. Same conference room?

[Alice]: Yep, same room. Just one hour later. Thanks for being flexible!

[Bob]: No problem. I'll update my calendar. See you at 10.
