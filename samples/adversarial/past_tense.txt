[Alice]: How was the client meeting last Thursday?

[Bob]: It went well actually. We met at their downtown office at 2 PM and went over the proposal for about an hour.

[Alice]: Nice. Did they seem receptive?

[Bob]: Very much so. We also had dinner afterward at that Italian place on Main Street. Started around 7, didn't leave until almost 10.

[Alice]: Wow, long dinner. Was the whole team there?

[Bob]: Just me, Carol, and the two leads from their side. Oh, and we had a quick coffee catch-up with Dave yesterday morning at 9.

[Alice]: I heard about that. He mentioned you guys talked about the timeline.

[Bob]: Yeah, we went over everything. Good meeting overall.

[Alice]: Great to hear. Thanks for the update.
