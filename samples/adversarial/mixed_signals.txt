[Alice]: So Bob, a few things. First, yeah right, like I'm going to wake up at 5 AM for a sunrise yoga session. Not happening.

[Bob]: Ha! Okay but seriously, we do need to schedule the quarterly review. How about next Tuesday at 2 PM?

[Alice]: Tuesday at 2 works. Conference Room B. Oh and wouldn't it be hilarious if we scheduled the board meeting at a bowling alley?

[Bob]: That would go over great with the executives. Sure, let me just book lanes for 20 people.

[Alice]: I'm dying. Okay but back to reality - can you also set up a 30-minute sync with the design team for Wednesday morning? Say 10 AM?

[Bob]: Wednesday at 10, got it. I'll book the small meeting room.

[Alice]: Perfect. And maybe we should all go skydiving for the next team building. I hear it really builds trust.

[Bob]: Absolutely. Nothing says teamwork like jumping out of a plane together.

[Alice]: Right? Okay I think that's it for real items. Everything else was just me being ridiculous.

[Bob]: Noted. Tuesday at 2, Wednesday at 10. Done.
