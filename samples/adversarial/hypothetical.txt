[Alice]: I've been thinking about team morale lately.

[Bob]: Yeah, it's been a rough quarter. People seem burnt out.

[Alice]: What if we scheduled a team retreat? Like maybe a weekend thing at a cabin somewhere.

[Bob]: That could be nice. Or what about a team cooking class? I saw one downtown that does corporate events.

[Alice]: Ooh that's a thought. If we did something like that, it would probably need to be on a Friday afternoon so people don't have to give up their weekends.

[Bob]: True. We'd also need to check the budget. Last time I looked, the team activities fund was pretty low.

[Alice]: Yeah, let me look into it. It's all hypothetical at this point anyway. We'd need approval from Sarah first.

[Bob]: For sure. Just brainstorming. Let me know what Sarah says if you bring it up.

[Alice]: Will do. Back to actual work now.
