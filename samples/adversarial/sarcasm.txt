[Alice]: Hey Bob, how's the workload this week?

[Bob]: Oh you know, just drowning in spreadsheets. Living the dream.

[Alice]: Yeah totally. Hey, let's definitely have a meeting at 3 AM to discuss the TPS reports. That sounds super productive.

[Bob]: Oh absolutely. And after that we should schedule a team retreat to the moon. I hear the conference rooms there are out of this world.

[Alice]: Ha! You crack me up. But seriously, did you finish the quarterly report?

[Bob]: Yeah, sent it over an hour ago. Should be in your inbox.

[Alice]: Great, I'll take a look. Talk later.
