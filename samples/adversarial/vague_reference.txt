[Alice]: We should really catch up sometime. It's been ages.

[Bob]: Yeah, for sure. We should grab coffee or something.

[Alice]: Definitely. Maybe sometime next month? Things are crazy right now.

[Bob]: Same here. Let's circle back when things calm down.

[Alice]: Sounds like a plan. Or not a plan, more like a general intention.

[Bob]: Ha, exactly. An aspiration. We'll figure it out eventually.

[Alice]: Cool. Talk soon.

[Bob]: Later!
