[Alice]: Did you watch the game last night?

[Bob]: Yeah, it was incredible! That last-minute goal was unbelievable.

[Alice]: I know right? I couldn't believe it. I was yelling at the TV.

[Bob]: Same here. My neighbors probably thought I was losing it.

[Alice]: Ha! So what did you think about the new player? He looked pretty solid out there.

[Bob]: Definitely an improvement over last season. The whole defense looked tighter.

[Alice]: For sure. Anyway, have a good rest of your day.

[Bob]: You too! Talk later.
