# fn-6-m69.6 Demo output enhancements & new CRUD sample transcripts

## Description
Update demo output to show matched event info for updates/deletes and create new sample transcripts that exercise update and delete scenarios.

**Files to modify:**
- `src/cal_ai/demo_output.py` — For UPDATE actions: show "Matched existing: [title] at [time]" and before/after field changes. For DELETE actions: show "Removing: [title] at [time]".
- `src/cal_ai/models/extraction.py` — Add `matched_event_title: Optional[str] = None` to sync result model if needed for display.

**Files to create:**
- `samples/update_meeting.txt` — Conversation where speakers reschedule an existing meeting (tests UPDATE flow).
- `samples/cancel_event.txt` — Conversation where speakers cancel a planned event (tests DELETE flow).
- `samples/mixed_crud.txt` — Conversation with a mix of create, update, and delete actions.

**Files to modify (tests):**
- `tests/unit/test_demo_output.py` — Tests for new display formats.
- `tests/unit/test_sample_transcripts.py` — Validate new sample files parse correctly.

**Sample transcript format:**
Use existing `[Speaker]: text` format. Include natural language that references existing events:
- Update: "Let's move the team standup to 10 AM instead of 9"
- Delete: "Cancel tomorrow's code review, something came up"
- Mixed: "Set up a lunch at noon, push standup to 10, and cancel the retrospective"
## Acceptance
- [ ] Demo output shows matched event info for UPDATE actions
- [ ] Demo output shows event being removed for DELETE actions
- [ ] At least 3 new sample transcripts (update, delete, mixed CRUD)
- [ ] Sample transcripts follow existing `[Speaker]: text` format
- [ ] New samples parse correctly (validated by tests)
- [ ] Demo output tests updated for new formats
- [ ] ruff clean
## Done summary
Enhanced demo output to show matched event info for UPDATE actions ("Matched existing: <title> at <time>") and DELETE actions ("Removing: <title> at <time>"). Created 3 new CRUD sample transcripts (update_meeting.txt, cancel_event.txt, mixed_crud.txt) and added comprehensive tests for all new functionality.
